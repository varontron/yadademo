The temperature and windspeed scatterplot represents conditions recorded at the Norwood, MA airport weather station, near Dave’s morning starting/evening end point. This weather station doesn’t supply precipitation data. Dave doesn’t cycle when it’s snowing, so omitting precipitation from the analysis is a reasonable tradeoff compared to using data from nearest alternative weather station, which is not directly on his route and does not report windspeed.
