<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://github.com/Novartis/YADA">YADA</a>
  demo application. This site is designed to demonstrate some of the major
  capabilities of the YADA framework.</p>
<p>The site presents a basic statistical analysis of cycle-commuting
  economics and performance, based on data collected between 2011 and
  2016 while commuting by bicycle from Norwood, MA to Cambridge, MA. The goal of
  the analysis is to calculate the true cost of bicycle-commuting in terms of
  car-commuting, in order to determine if it is economical, as is commonly
  believed, and how many daily commutes are required to "break even."</p>
<p>Additional analysis is executed upon cycling performance data, to help with
  motivation and fitness.</p>
<p>The data incorporated in the analysis include:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance</strong> data was collected via a variety of onboard
      sensors connected to the <a href="">Cyclemeter</a> iPhone app.  Additionally,
      car-commuting data were recorded to enable evidence-based comparative
      analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Expenses</strong> data is a careful running tally of all expenses
      incurred to support cycle-commuting, including parts, accessories,
      clothing, and even the bicycle itself.</li>
    <li><strong>Car Commuting</strong> data is comprised of historical gas prices
      per the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep</strong> data is collected nightly using the
      <a href="">Sleep Cycle</a> iPhone app.  Heart rate data is collected using
      this app as well, using it's light-based meter, upon waking.</li>
  </ul>
