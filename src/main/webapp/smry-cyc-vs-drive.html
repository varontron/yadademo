<p>A comparison of the distributions of elapsed time measurements of car and
cycle commuting.</p>
<p>Car commuting is typically faster (18 minutes faster, on median) but the range
of durations (standard deviation) is broad. Cycling is slower, but
much more consistent.  On a weekly basis, (18 min x 5 days) it takes 90 minutes longer to commute. Considering I no longer spend 3 hours per week at the gym (or getting to and from it), bicycle-commuting represents a <strong>net-savings in time.</strong></p>
<p>Also, driving isn't going to get any more efficient, but cycling time improve through both fitness, and a lighter bike. It's one of my goals to reduce the median difference to less than 10 minutes, which would save at least an additional 40 minutes per week.</p>
<p><strong>Data Source</strong>: Performance (SQLite)<br/>
<strong>YADA Features</strong>: ScriptPostprocessor Plugin, SQLiteAdaptor<br/>
<strong>How it works</strong>: The query <a href="http://localhost:8081/yada/q/CYC+select+round+trips/pz/-1/c/false/pl/ScriptPostprocessor,time_pdf.py">CYC select round trips</a> is executed via URL. Days on which data was collected in only one direction (inbound or outbound) are omitted. Thus the dataset is exclusive to "same-day round trips," (the vast majority of data.)</p>
<p>The query reformats the "startTime" field to omit the time component, and then the results are grouped by date, combining "runTime" and "stoppedTime" into a total "elapsedTime" value for the day's round trip.</p>
<p>Before returning, the result of the query is passed to the <code>time_pdf.py</code> python script via the <code>ScriptPostprocessor</code> API, simply by including the <code>pl</code> url parameter (or path-style parameter.)  The python script separates the data into cycling and driving datasets, and then calculates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)</a> from the elapsed time measurements using <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.html">scipy.stats.gaussian_kde</a>. An array of 1000 objects containing the x and y domain values is then returned to the browser for plotting.</p>
